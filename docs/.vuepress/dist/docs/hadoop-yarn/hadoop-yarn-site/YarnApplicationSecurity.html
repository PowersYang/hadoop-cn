They also need to start testing on secure clusters during early development stages, in order to write code that actually works.</p> <h2 id="how-yarn-security-works"><a href="#how-yarn-security-works" class="header-anchor">#</a> How YARN Security works</h2> <p>YARN Resource Managers (RMs) and Node Managers (NMs) co-operate to execute the user’s application with the identity and hence access rights of that user.</p> <p>The (active) Resource Manager:</p> <ol><li><p>Finds space in a cluster to deploy the core of the application, the Application Master (AM).</p></li> <li><p>Requests that the NM on that node allocate a container and start the AM in it.</p></li> <li><p>Communicates with the AM, so that the AM can request new containers and manipulate/release current ones, and to provide notifications about allocated and running containers.</p></li></ol> <p>The Node Managers:</p> <ol><li><p>Localize resources: Download from HDFS or other filesystem into a local directory. This is done using the delegation tokens attached to the container launch context. (For non-HDFS resources, using other credentials such as object store login details in cluster configuration files)</p></li> <li><p>Start the application as the user.</p></li> <li><p>Monitor the application and report failure to the RM.</p></li></ol> <p>To execute code in the cluster, a YARN application must:</p> <ol><li>Have a client-side application which sets up the ApplicationSubmissionContext detailing what is to be launched. This includes:</li></ol> <pre><code>* A list of files in the cluster’s filesystem to be “localized”.
* The environment variables to set in the container.
* The commands to execute in the container to start the application.
* Any security credentials needed by YARN to launch the application.
* Any security credentials needed by the application to interact with any Hadoop cluster services and applications.
</code></pre> <ol start="2"><li><p>Have an Application Master which, when launched, registers with the YARN RM and listens for events. Any AM which wishes to execute work in other containers must request them off the RM, and, when allocated, create a ContainerLaunchContext containing the command to execute, the environment to execute the command, binaries to localize and all relevant security credentials.</p></li> <li><p>Even with the NM handling the localization process, the AM must itself be able to retrieve the security credentials supplied at launch time so that it itself may work with HDFS and any other services, and to pass some or all of these credentials down to the launched containers.</p></li></ol> <h3 id="acquiring-and-adding-tokens-to-a-yarn-application"><a href="#acquiring-and-adding-tokens-to-a-yarn-application" class="header-anchor">#</a> Acquiring and Adding tokens to a YARN Application</h3> <p>The delegation tokens which a YARN application needs must be acquired from a program executing as an authenticated user. For a YARN application, this means the user launching the application. It is the client-side part of the YARN application which must do this:</p> <ol><li>Log in via UserGroupInformation.</li> <li>Identify all tokens which must be acquired.</li> <li>Request these tokens from the specific Hadoop services.</li> <li>Marshall all tokens into a byte buffer.</li> <li>Add them to the ContainerLaunchContext within the ApplicationSubmissionContext.</li></ol> <p>Which tokens are required? Normally, at least a token to access HDFS.</p> <p>An application must request a delegation token from every filesystem with which it intends to interact —including the cluster’s main FS. FileSystem.addDelegationTokens(renewer, credentials) can be used to collect these; it is a no-op on those filesystems which do not issue tokens (including non-kerberized HDFS clusters).</p> <p>Applications talking to other services, such as Apache HBase and Apache Hive, must request tokens from these services, using the libraries of these services to acquire delegation tokens. All tokens can be added to the same set of credentials, then saved to a byte buffer for submission.</p> <p>The Application Timeline Server also needs a delegation token. This is handled automatically on AM launch.</p> <h3 id="extracting-tokens-within-the-am"><a href="#extracting-tokens-within-the-am" class="header-anchor">#</a> Extracting tokens within the AM</h3> <p>When the Application Master is launched and any of the UGI/Hadoop operations which trigger a user login invoked, the UGI class will automatically load in all tokens saved in the file named by the environment variable HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION.</p> <p>This happens on an insecure cluster along with a secure one, and on a secure cluster even if a keytab is used by the application. Why? Because the AM/RM token needed to authenticate the application with the YARN RM is always supplied this way.</p> <p>This means you have a relative similar workflow across secure and insecure clusters.</p> <ol><li><p>Suring AM startup, log in to Kerberos.

Your AM code does not need to worry about this process</p> <h3 id="token-renewal-on-am-restart"><a href="#token-renewal-on-am-restart" class="header-anchor">#</a> Token Renewal on AM Restart</h3> <p>Even if an application is renewing tokens regularly, if an AM fails and is restarted, it gets restarted from that original ApplicationSubmissionContext. The tokens there may have expired, so localization may fail, even before the issue of credentials to talk to other services.</p> <p>How is this problem addressed? The YARN Resource Manager gets a new token for the node managers, if needed.</p> <p>More precisely</p> <ol><li>The token passed by the RM to the NM for localization is refreshed/updated as needed.</li> <li>Tokens in the app launch context for use by the application are not refreshed. That is, if it has an out of date HDFS token —that token is not renewed. This also holds for tokens for for Hive, HBase, etc.</li> <li>Therefore, to survive AM restart after token expiry, your AM has to get the NMs to localize the keytab or make no HDFS accesses until (somehow) a new token has been passed to them from a client.</li></ol> <p>This is primarily an issue for long-lived services (see below).</p> <h3 id="unmanaged-application-masters"><a href="#unmanaged-application-masters" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unmanaged Application Masters</h3> <p>Unmanaged application masters are not launched in a container set up by the RM and NM, so cannot automatically pick up an AM/RM token at launch time. The YarnClient.getAMRMToken() API permits an Unmanaged AM to request an AM/RM token. Consult UnmanagedAMLauncher for the specifics.</p> <h3 id="identity-on-an-insecure-cluster-hadoop-user-name"><a href="#identity-on-an-insecure-cluster-hadoop-user-name" class="header-anchor">#</a> Identity on an insecure cluster: HADOOP_USER_NAME</h3> <p>In an insecure cluster, the application will run as the identity of the account of the node manager, typically something such as yarn or mapred. By default, the application will access HDFS as that user, with a different home directory, and with a different user identified in audit logs and on file system owner attributes.</p> <p>This can be avoided by having the client identify the identify of the HDFS/Hadoop user under which the application is expected to run. This does not affect the OS-level user or the application’s access rights to the local machine.</p> <p>When Kerberos is disabled, the identity of a user is picked up by Hadoop first from the environment variable HADOOP_USER_NAME, then from the OS-level username (e.g. the system property user.name).</p> <p>YARN applications should propagate the user name of the user launching an application by setting this environment variable.</p> <pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
String userName = UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getUserName();
env.put(UserGroupInformation.HADOOP_USER_NAME, userName);
containerLaunchContext.setEnvironment(env);
</code></pre> <p>Note that this environment variable is picked up in all applications which talk to HDFS via the hadoop libraries. That is, if set, it is the identity picked up by HBase and other applications executed within the environment of a YARN container within which this environment variable is set.</p> <h3 id="oozie-integration-and-hadoop-token-file-location"><a href="#oozie-integration-and-hadoop-token-file-location" class="header-anchor">#</a> Oozie integration and HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION</h3> <p>Apache Oozie can launch an application in a secure cluster either by acquiring all relevant credentials, saving them to a file in the local filesystem, then setting the path to this file in the environment variable HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION. This is of course the same environment variable passed down by YARN in launched containers, as is similar content: a byte array with credentials.</p> <p>Here, however, the environment variable is set in the environment executing the YARN client. This client must use the token information saved in the named file instead of acquiring any tokens of its own.</p> <p>Loading in the token file is automatic: UGI does it during user login.</p> <p>The client is then responsible for passing the same credentials into the AM launch context. This can be done simply by passing down the current credentials.</p> <pre><code>credentials = new Credentials(
    UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getCredentials());

This process is handled automatically in YarnClientImpl if ATS is enabled in a secure cluster. Similarly, the AM-side TimelineClient YARN service class manages token renewal automatically via the ATS’s SPNEGO-authenticated REST API.</p> <p>If you need to prepare a set of delegation tokens for a YARN application launch via Oozie, this can be done via the timeline client API.</p> <pre><code>try(TimelineClient timelineClient = TimelineClient.createTimelineClient()) {
  timelineClient.init(conf);

Malicious code (or code escaping some form of sandbox) could read the keytab, and hence have access to the cluster until the keys expire or are revoked.</p> <p>This is the strategy implemented by Apache Slider (incubating).</p> <h3 id="am-keytab-distributed-via-yarn-am-regenerates-delegation-tokens-for-containers"><a href="#am-keytab-distributed-via-yarn-am-regenerates-delegation-tokens-for-containers" class="header-anchor">#</a> AM keytab distributed via YARN; AM regenerates delegation tokens for containers.</h3> <ol><li><p>A keytab is uploaded to HDFS by the client.</p></li> <li><p>When launching the AM, the keytab is listed as a resource to localize to the AM’s container.</p></li> <li><p>The Application Master is configured with the relative path to the keytab, and logs in with UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab().

The rest of the algorithm: AM regenerated tokens passed to containers over IPC.</p> <p>This is the strategy used by Apache Spark 1.5+, with a netty-based protocol between containers and the AM for token updates.</p> <p>Because only the AM has direct access to the keytab, it is less exposed. Code running in the containers only has access to the delegation tokens.</p> <p>However, those containers will have access to HDFS from the tokens passed in at container launch, so will have access to the copy of the keytab used for launching the AM. While the AM could delete that keytab on launch, doing so would stop YARN being able to successfully relaunch the AM after any failure.</p> <h3 id="client-side-token-push"><a href="#client-side-token-push" class="header-anchor">#</a> Client-side Token Push</h3> <p>This strategy may be the sole one acceptable to a strict operations team: a client process running on an account holding a Kerberos TGT negotiates with all needed cluster services for new delegation tokens, tokens which are then pushed out to the Application Master via some RPC interface.</p> <p>This does require the client process to be re-executed on a regular basis; a cron or Oozie job can do this. The AM will need to implement an IPC API over which renewed tokens can be provided. (Note that as Oozie can collect the tokens itself, all the updater application needs to do whenever executed is set up an IPC connection with the AM and pass up the current user’s credentials).</p> <h2 id="securing-yarn-application-web-uis-and-rest-apis"><a href="#securing-yarn-application-web-uis-and-rest-apis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Securing YARN Application Web UIs and REST APIs</h2> <p>YARN provides a straightforward way of giving every YARN application SPNEGO authenticated web pages: it implements SPNEGO authentication in the Resource Manager Proxy.</p> <p>YARN web UI are expected to load the AM proxy filter when setting up its web UI; this filter will redirect all HTTP Requests coming from any host other than the RM Proxy hosts to an RM proxy, to which the client app/browser must re-issue the request.
